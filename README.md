libctf
======

libctf is a C99 BSD-licensed implementation of the second version of the 
Compact C Type Format.  Initially developed as a part of the Google Summer of
Code 2014, supported and mentored by the FreeBSD Project. Code is written with
multiple platforms in mind and can be used in BSD, illumos and Linux worlds.

The library and it's practical usage is the topic of my on-going [bachelor 
thesis](https://github.com/lovasko/bc_thesis).
